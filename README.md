### Redux
This project uses redux.  If you are unfamiliar with it see https://redux.js.org/.  There is alot there though so at a minimum understand:
* actions and reducers
* containers vs components: https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0
* middleware and enhancers

### Create React App
